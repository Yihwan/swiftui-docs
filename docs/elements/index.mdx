# Elements (aka Views)
The term "element" is a bit of a misnomer, because technically that's not a thing in SwiftUI. 
Instead, we have [Views](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/view). But coming 
from a web development background, I like to think of certain `Views` as individual 
elements of the user interface. 

Like in HTML, which is composed of a bunch of elements, or React, which creates HTML
from a bunch of components, everything in SwiftUI is composed of views.

# SwiftUI Docs 
*An unofficial guide to Apple's SwiftUI.*

SwiftUI is great! But sifting through the [official spec](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui) can be daunting, 
and learning exclusively from tutorials can feel incomplete.  

For example, a tutorial tells you to style `Text("Hello world!")` with `.font(.title)`.
That's nice, but what are the other options besides `.title`? What do these other options look like? 

The [provided docs](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/font/3055727-title) aren't
always the most visual, and Xcode's built-in (Option+click) doc search feature isn't always the most helpful. 

Wouldn't it be great if we could [scan the docs](/elements/text#font) and 
instantly see how SwiftUI works? I thought so, which is why I'll take notes here as I learn 
SwiftUI myself. Maybe you'll find this helpful too.

This site isn't intended to encompass an exhaustive specification of SwiftUI and everything
else in the Apple developer ecosystem. Instead, think of it as a quick-start guide (with pictures!) to 
hit the ground running.

Am I missing something? Yes, because I just started. Did I get something horribly 
wrong? Probably, because I rarely know what I'm doing. But that's all okay, 
because this project is [open-source](https://github.com/Yihwan/swiftui-docs) - 
and contributions are welcome!

If you have any questions or would otherwise like to get in touch, 
feel free to send me a message at [hi@yihwan.kim](mailto:hi@yihwan.kim) or find me on 
most things @yihwan. 

Happy hacking!
